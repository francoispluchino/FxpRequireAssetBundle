The Fxp RequireAssetBundle is a helper for twig to manage automatically the required assets
with Webpack. It allows to define the required assets (script, style) directly
in the Twig template and adds the HTML links of the assets automatically to the
right place in the template, while removing duplicates.

##### Features include:

- All features of [Fxp Require Asset](https://github.com/fxpio/fxp-require-asset)
- Compatible with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and source maps (require the plugin
  [webpack-manifest-plugin](https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin) or
  [assets-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/kossnocorp/assets-webpack-plugin))
- Configure (in global config or in container compiler pass):
  - the locale asset defined by each entry
  - the replacement of assets by other assets
- Compiling the final list of asset in cache to increase performance for `assets-webpack-plugin`
- Native support of the symfony templating (base URL and version)

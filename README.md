The Fxp RequireAssetBundle is a helper for assetic and twig to manage automatically the
required assets. It allows to define the required assets (javascript, stylesheet) directly
in the Twig template and adds the HTML links of the assets automatically to the right place
in the template, while removing duplicates. The bundle retrieves automatically asset dependencies
defined by [fxp/composer-asset-plugin](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin)
and adds automatically the assets in the Assetic manager.

The configuration included in the bundles can be overloaded in the global configuration,
in this way, even if a Twig template uses a specific asset, and your global config changes
the URL output of assets (output rewriting), the Twig template will automatically include
the correct URL of asset, without your having to overload the Twig template.

##### Features include:

- All features of [Fxp Require Asset](https://github.com/francoispluchino/fxp-require-asset)
- Automatically copy all assets:
  - of NPM/Bower packages in the assetic public directory
  - defined in resources section of a Symfony2 Bundle (except `config`, `doc`, `license(s)`, `meta`, `public`, `skeleton`, `views`)
- Compiling the final list of asset in cache for increase performance
- Updating the list of assets when the source files requires a cache refresh (`dev` mode)
- Native support of the assetic manager (command `assetic:dump` and controller)
- Configure (in global config or in container compiler pass):
  - the assetic filters of asset package by the extensions
  - the assetic filters for all asset packages
  - the custom asset package
  - the rewrite output path of asset
